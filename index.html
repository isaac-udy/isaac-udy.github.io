				I'm a software engineer with a background in Android development. Recently I have been heavliy involved in projects focusing
				on mobile augmented reality, graphics programming, and audio/video processing.

				Lead Android Developer

			</div>
			<div class="content-body">
				As the lead Android developer at 8i I was accountable for the delivery of Android projects. This involved working closely
				with designers, iOS developers, and the other members of the Android team to ensure that project milestones were met,
				and key deliverables went out on time.
				<br/> I have worked on several projects in this role, all focused on mobile augmented reality. The development work in this
				role was an interesting blend of traditional Android development coupled with lower level work involving graphics and
				audio/video processing.
				<br/>Outside of these main projects, I have also contributed to several other areas of the business. This includes 8i's Unity
				plugin, exploration of mobile virtual reality, research into augmented reality scene integration, and other small exploration/research
				based projects.
